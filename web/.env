# To make a better code, is a good practice to set type for everything
# including these env vars, please do it at:
# /src/vite-env.d.ts at interface ImportMetaEnv
# To call these envs always use useEnv() hook.
# All envs needs to start with AUCTION_ prefix
# when using useEnv() you don't need to put the prefix

# set envs type at /src/vite-env.d.ts
# call envs with useEnv()
